# NOT Simply Love (StepMania 5)

If you're looking for Simply Love, the Stepmania 5 theme that is widely used, this isn't it. This is a mashup of weird ideas used on an SMX AIO cab, and for people using 16:9 mode Stepmania. Use at your own risk. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

For Simply Love, please visit https://github.com/dguzek/Simply-Love-SM5 or click the link near "forked from..." above.

If you have questions, feel free to drop by the #theme-stuff channel on the Stamina Nation discord and ping me (@IKA3K): http://www.staminanation.com

## ! IMPORTANT !

The file [Languages/en.ini](https://github.com/IKA3K/Stamina-House-Tokyo/blob/master/Languages/en.ini#L100) has the string "Stamina House Tokyo" in it for the HeaderText for ScreenSelectMusic. You may want to change this to the text for your own setup.

## Who is this theme NOT aimed at

1. People who are using a setup with a non-widescreen display. This is a widescreen only setup.
2. Any other mode other than 4-panel dance. This includes doubles players. Course mode may fail. Mods will not be tested.
3. People using centered 1-Player mode -- support will be coming in the future but not now.

## Who is this forked theme aimed at

1. SMX AIO cab owners.
2. One or two pad setups with a widescreen display that is relatively close and/or big.
3. Streamers who want to free up empty space so that they can overlay their camera on top of an unused section of the screen.
4. Stamina players, especially reverse stamina players, who could use a density graph that shows upcoming information close to the targets rather than off to the side.

## What's specifically different

0. Not meant for playing on anything other than 16:9. No really, don't try it.
1. Backgrounds are scaled to fit above the step stats. And hey, it works with two players at the same time!
2. Step statistics should never really be turned off. I'll disable that at some point.
3. Density graph scrolls showing 2 minutes worth of info. There is no 5 minute lifebar/stamina graph.
4. Step stats available on the ScreenSelectMusic showing simple breakdown if it doesn't fit, full breakdown (minus the first/last breaks)

## TODOs/Known Bugs

0. Measure counter while in-song doesn't know about 1 measure streams, and computes the total stream incorrectly.
1. Make 21:9 and other funky offsets work
2. Add more spaces for longer bois (so you can get to 100000 combo without worrying about spacing)
3. Add live stats on timing for single player play
