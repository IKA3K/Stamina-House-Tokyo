# NOT Simply Love (StepMania 5)

If you're looking for Simply Love, the Stepmania 5 theme that is widely used, this isn't it. This is a mashup of weird ideas used on an SMX AIO cab, and for people using 16:9 mode Stepmania.

For Simply Love, please visit https://github.com/dguzek/Simply-Love-SM5 or click the link near "forked from..." above.

## ! IMPORTANT !

The file [Languages/en.ini](https://github.com/IKA3K/Stamina-House-Tokyo/blob/master/Languages/en.ini#L100) has the string "Stamina House Tokyo" in it for the HeaderText for ScreenSelectMusic. You may want to change this to the text for your own setup.

## What's different

0. Not meant for playing on anything other than 16:9. No really, don't try it.
1. Backgrounds are scaled to fit above the step stats. And hey, it works with two players at the same time!
2. Step statistics should never really be turned off. I'll disable that at some point.
3. Density graph scrolls showing 2 minutes worth of info
4. Step stats available on the ScreenSelectMusic showing simple breakdown if it doesn't fit, full breakdown (minus the first/last breaks)

## TODOs

1. Make 21:9 and other funky offsets work
2. Add more spaces for longer bois (so you can get to 100000 combo without worrying about spacing)
3. Add live stats on timing for single player play
