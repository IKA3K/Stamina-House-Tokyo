# NOT Simply Love (StepMania 5)

## What's different

0. Not meant for playing on anything other than 16:9. No really, don't try it.
1. Backgrounds are scaled to fit above the step stats. And hey, it works with two players at the same time!
2. Step statistics should never really be turned off. I'll disable that at some point.
3. Density graph scrolls showing 2 minutes worth of info
4. Step stats available on the ScreenSelectMusic showing simple breakdown if it doesn't fit, full breakdown (minus the first/last breaks)

## TODOs

1. Make 21:9 and other funky offsets work
2. Add more spaces for longer bois (so you can get to 100000 combo without worrying about spacing)
3. Add live stats on timing for single player play
